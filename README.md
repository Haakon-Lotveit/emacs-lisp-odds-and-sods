This is my little repository of little snippets of code I've picked up here and there.

It's stuff that I've made, and that I want to keep somewhere where I can easily get to it.
And if you want it too, then I'm flattered and you should help yourself.

The reason there's github stuff is because the melpa stuff doesn't always work on Windows, and possibly other places.
So they're there as a workaround. If 26 or something fix this stuff, I'll be happy to remove it and just use package.el exclusively.
Last time I tried this was August, 2017 on Windows 10.
